# Scientific Data Integrity

A repository for the data-integrity project, which emcompasses both
hashing data at the point of integrity and establishing a chain of
custody and quality for reagents.

For reagent integrity, it would be wise to first start with the domain
with the highest stakes: namely medical testing.

## Reagent Integrity

 1. Structure
    1. Aggregate QC documents
    2. Set up a common structure
 2. Common QC platforms
    1. Research common QC platforms
    2. Consider implementing an automated solution that integrates
       with the internal manufacturing step-verification involved
       medical testing reagents.
 3. PRISM
    1. Set up PRISM identities and tracking for reagents.
 4. Contact NIH, AMA, CDC, WHO, etc.
    1. Find existing database standards.
    2. Adapt to blockchain migration.

## Data Integrity

### Outline

 1. Plan for data hashing and submission at the point of acquisition.
    1. Research software and connectivity mechanisms.
    2. Identify how to source funding on the blockchain.
    3. Develop proof of concept.
 2. Proposal to BD
    1. Research current initiatives
    2. Plan point of contact (audience)
    3. Prepare presentation
    4. Contact
    5. Present
 3. Proposal to NIH
    1. Research current initiatives
    2. Contact Flow Repository to see if they would be willing to
       partner.
	   
### Tasks

 * [ ]  Task force to identify current projects and implement
        proof-of-concept for data hashing
 * [ ]  Task force to imagine how an academic system of anonymous or
        pseudonymous publishing would work (apropos of Charles
        Hoskinson)
 * [ ]  We should speak with FlowJo at BD
 * [ ]  Connect with the API developers for Flow Repository

### Revolution in Scientific Transparency

These are the notes from the twitter space.

 1. Pasteur put in his will not to let anyone see his lab notebook.
 2. Fraud and abuse in science as shown by [Elisabeth
    Bik](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z) in [her
    twitter](https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest) along with
    @mortenoxe, @TigerBB8 and @SmutClyde
 3. The field is pushing for more transparency, rigor, and
    reproducibility.
	   1. [NIH policies and
          guidelines](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/rigor-and-reproducibility-forms-f)
	   2. [FlowRepository](https://flowrepository.org/) and the [role
          of Flow
          Cytometry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cyto.a.23940)
	   3. [Journals](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a)
	   4. [Ngram](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rigor+and+reproducibility&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Crigor%20and%20reproducibility%3B%2Cc0)
	   5. [How-to
          guide](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.01902-16)
 4. Potential strategies to get started
	   1. Hash data automatically and store hashes in NFTs on the
          blockchain.
	   2. [Publishing](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a)
	   3. Publishing anonymously and verifying data authenticity
	   4. VABrandon's note that QC and reagents could be stored
          on-chain. I should say that probably hashes will be
          sufficient, but we can do side-chains.
 5. Action items
	   1. Task force to identify current projects and implement
          proof-of-concept for data hashing
	   2. Task force to imagine how an academic system of anonymous or
          pseudonymous publishing would work (apropos of Charles
          Hoskinson)
       3. We should speak with FlowJo at BD.
       4. Connect with the API developers for Flow Repository
