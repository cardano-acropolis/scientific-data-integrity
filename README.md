# Scientific Data Integrity

A repository for the data-integrity project, which emcompasses both hashing data at the point of integrity and establishing a chain of custody and quality for reagents. 

For reagent integrity, it would be wise to first start with the domain with the highest stakes: namely medical testing.

## Reagent Integrity

 1. Structure
    1. Aggregate QC documents
    2. Set up a common structure
 2. Common QC platforms
    1. Research common QC platforms
    2. Consider implementing an automated solution that integrates with the internal manufacturing step-verification involved medical testing reagents.
 3. PRISM
    1. Set up PRISM identities and tracking for reagents.
 4. Contact NIH, AMA, CDC, WHO, etc.
    1. Find existing database standards.
    2. Adapt to blockchain migration.

## Data Integrity

 1. Plan for data hashing and submission at the point of acquisition.
   1. Research software and connectivity mechanisms.
   2. Identify how to source funding on the blockchain.
   3. Develop proof of concept.
 2. Proposal to BD
   1. Research current initiatives
   2. Plan point of contact (audience)
   3. Prepare presentation
   4. Contact
   5. Present
 3. Proposal to NIH
   1. Research current initiatives
   2. Contact Flow Repository to see if they would be willing to partner.
